# Compass

## Project Description

Compass is a geocache website built using Java Spring Backend, React Frontend and Google Maps API. Users are able to login in and create their own accounts. Users can create Geocaches by using a simple form for information and clicking anywhere on the map for location. Users can pick any available geocache to look for, and are given an alloted time limit before it is released to the public again. Users can see all the geocaches, the ones available for them to search for (either in the whole world or ones closetst to their current location), their own geocaches and the cache they are searching for.
